# Get And Clean Data Course Project
This is the repo prepared for Course Project related to "Get and Clean Data" course.

## How it works
This R script load the "dplyr" library, downloads and unzips the data file, and prepares the data to generate the requested result, which is average of mean and standard deviation calculated per row of observations grouped by activity and subject.

## Background about the data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Course deliverable
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
